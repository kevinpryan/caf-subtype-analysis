# Introduction

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a heterogeneous cell type found in the tumour microenvironment. They have a wide array of functions, and tend to be immunosuppressive and cancer-promoting. There have been many attempts to characterise subtypes of CAFs, with much transcriptomic analysis being carried out in the Mechta-Grigoriou lab in Institut Curie. They have identified 4 'subtypes' which can be separated based on the expression of different markers:

 -  S1: FAP^High^, CD29^Med-High^, α^SMAHigh^, PDPN^High^, PDGFRβ^High^
 -  S2: FAP^Neg^, CD29^Low^, αSMANeg-^Low^, PDPN^Low^, PDGFRβ^Low^
 -  S3: FAP^Neg-Low^, CD29^Med^, αSMA^Neg-Low^, PDPN^Low^, PDGFRβ^Low-Med^
 -  S4: FAP^Low-Med^, CD29^High^, αSMA^High^, PDPN^Low^, PDGFRβ^Med^

FACS gating strategies can be used to isolate these various subtypes. The Mechta-Grigoriou group have done this and have generated bulk RNA-sequencing data for the S1, S3 and S4 subtypes. They generated scRNA-sequencing data for the S1 subtype. This data was deposited on the European Genome Phenome Archive, and was accessed via a Data Transfer Agreement.

The following summarises the data obtained:


The data was processed using nf-core/rnaseq version using the default parameters.
