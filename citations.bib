  abstract        = {Although fibroblast heterogeneity is recognized in primary tumors, both its characterization in and its impact on metastases remain unknown. Here, combining flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and RNA-sequencing on breast cancer samples, we identify four Cancer-Associated Fibroblast (CAF) subpopulations in metastatic lymph nodes (LN). Two myofibroblastic subsets, CAF-S1 and CAF-S4, accumulate in LN and correlate with cancer cell invasion. By developing functional assays on primary cultures, we demonstrate that these subsets promote metastasis through distinct functions. While CAF-S1 stimulate cancer cell migration and initiate an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition through CXCL12 and TGF$\beta$ pathways, highly contractile CAF-S4 induce cancer cell invasion in 3-dimensions via NOTCH signaling. Patients with high levels of CAFs, particularly CAF-S4, in LN at diagnosis are prone to develop late distant metastases. Our findings suggest that CAF subset accumulation in LN is a prognostic marker, suggesting that CAF subsets could be examined in axillary LN at diagnosis. Cancer associated fibroblasts are known to promote the progression of cancer. Here, the authors show that two particular subsets of cancer associated fibroblasts induce metastasis but work via distinct mechanisms including, chemokine signalling and Notch signalling.},

  abstract        = {When identifying differentially expressed genes between two conditions using human population RNA-seq samples, we found a phenomenon by permutation analysis: two popular bioinformatics methods, DESeq2 and edgeR, have unexpectedly high false discovery rates. Expanding the analysis to limma-voom, NOISeq, dearseq, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test, we found that FDR control is often failed except for the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Particularly, the actual FDRs of DESeq2 and edgeR sometimes exceed 20{\%} when the target FDR is 5{\%}. Based on these results, for population-level RNA-seq studies with large sample sizes, we recommend the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.},

  abstract        = {In recent years RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful technology for transcriptome profiling. For a given gene, the number of mapped reads is not only dependent on its expression level and gene length, but also the sequencing depth. To normalize these dependencies, RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase of transcript per Million reads mapped) and TPM (Transcripts Per Million) are used to measure gene or transcript expression levels. A common misconception is that RPKM and TPM values are already normalized, and thus should be comparable across samples or RNA-seq projects. However, RPKM and TPM represent the relative abundance of a transcript among a population of sequenced transcripts, and therefore depend on the composition of the RNA population in a sample. Quite often, it is reasonable to assume that total RNA concentration and distributions is very close across compared samples. Nevertheless, the sequenced RNA repertoires may differ significantly under different experimental conditions and/or across sequencing protocols; thus, the proportion of gene expression is not directly comparable in such cases. In this review, we illustrate typical scenarios in which RPKM and TPM are misused, unintentionally, and hope to raise scientists' awareness of this issue when comparing them across samples or different sequencing protocols.},

  abstract        = {Single-cell RNA-sequencing has emerged as a powerful technique for characterizing cellular heterogeneity, but it is currently impractical on large sample cohorts and cannot be applied to fixed specimens collected as part of routine clinical care. We previously developed an approach for digital cytometry, called CIBERSORT, that enables estimation of cell type abundances from bulk tissue transcriptomes. We now introduce CIBERSORTx, a machine learning method that extends this framework to infer cell-type-specific gene expression profiles without physical cell isolation. By minimizing platform-specific variation, CIBERSORTx also allows the use of single-cell RNA-sequencing data for large-scale tissue dissection. We evaluated the utility of CIBERSORTx in multiple tumor types, including melanoma, where single-cell reference profiles were used to dissect bulk clinical specimens, revealing cell-type-specific phenotypic states linked to distinct driver mutations and response to immune checkpoint blockade. We anticipate that digital cytometry will augment single-cell profiling efforts, enabling cost-effective, high-throughput tissue characterization without the need for antibodies, disaggregation or viable cells. CIBERSORTx, a suite of computational tools, enables inference of cell type abundance and cell-type-specific gene expression profiles from bulk RNA profiles.},

abstract = {Inferring single-cell compositions and their contributions to global gene expression changes from bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets is a major challenge in oncology. Here we develop Bayesian cell proportion reconstruction inferred using statistical marginalization (BayesPrism), a Bayesian method to predict cellular composition and gene expression in individual cell types from bulk RNA-seq, using patient-derived, scRNA-seq as prior information. We conduct integrative analyses in primary glioblastoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and skin cutaneous melanoma to correlate cell type composition with clinical outcomes across tumor types, and explore spatial heterogeneity in malignant and nonmalignant cell states. We refine current cancer subtypes using gene expression annotation after exclusion of confounding nonmalignant cells. Finally, we identify genes whose expression in malignant cells correlates with macrophage infiltration, T cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells across multiple tumor types. Our work introduces a new lens to accurately infer cellular composition and expression in large cohorts of bulk RNA-seq data. Danko and colleagues develop BayesPrism, a bulk RNA sequencing deconvolution tool to infer cell type composition and cell-specific expression levels across clinical cancer datasets.},

abstract = {Motivation: The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene cluster plays a crucial role in adaptive immunity and is thus relevant in many biomedical applications. While next-generation sequencing data are often available for a patient, deducing the HLA genotype is difficult because of substantial sequence similarity within the cluster and exceptionally high variability of the loci. Established approaches, therefore, rely on specific HLA enrichment and sequencing techniques, coming at an additional cost and extra turnaround time. Result: We present OptiType, a novel HLA genotyping algorithm based on integer linear programming, capable of producing accurate predictions from NGS data not specifically enriched for the HLA cluster. We also present a comprehensive benchmark dataset consisting of RNA, exome and whole-genome sequencing data. OptiType significantly outperformed previously published in silico approaches with an overall accuracy of 97{\%} enabling its use in a broad range of applications.},
