This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to
GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and
a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

Here I want to curate them and get a list of markers that I can use to
construct a signature matrix for CIBERSORTx.
